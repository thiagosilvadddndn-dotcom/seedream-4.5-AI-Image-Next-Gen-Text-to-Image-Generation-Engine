# Seedream 4.5 AI: High-Performance Text-to-Image Generation 

## 🎨 Project Overview
This repository serves as the documentation hub for **Seedream**, a next-generation cloud-based AI image generation tool.

Designed to overcome the hardware limitations of local Stable Diffusion setups, Seedream allows creators to generate professional-grade artwork directly in the browser without requiring expensive NVIDIA GPUs.

## 🛠 Core Features
* **Zero Hardware Requirement:** All rendering is handled by our cloud clusters.
* **Version 4.5 Engine:** Enhanced semantic understanding for complex prompts (better lighting, composition, and anatomy).
* **Multi-Style Support:** Instantly switch between Anime, Photorealistic, 3D Render, and Oil Painting styles.

## 🚀 Online Generator
The core inference engine is hosted on our official platform. You can access the tool and start creating immediately:

## 📂 Prompt Engineering Best Practices
To get the best results with Seedream v4.5, we recommend the following prompt structure:

> `(Subject) + (Action/Context) + (Art Style) + (Lighting/Atmosphere) + --quality high`

**Example:**
* *"Cyberpunk street samurai, raining neon city, cinematic lighting, intricate details, 8k resolution"*

For a complete library of tested prompts and visual examples, please visit our **[Official Gallery](https://www.seedream4-5.cc)**.
