# seedream 4.5 AI Image Next-Gen-Text-to-Image-Generation-Engine

## 🎨 Project Overview
This repository serves as the documentation and resource hub for **SeaDream AI**, a cloud-based image generation tool designed for creators, designers, and developers.

Unlike local Stable Diffusion deployments that require expensive GPUs (NVIDIA 3090/4090), our engine allows users to generate high-fidelity images directly in the browser with optimized inference speeds.

## 🛠 Features & Capabilities
We focus on lowering the barrier to entry for AI art.
* **No GPU Required:** Cloud-side rendering.
* **Multi-Model Support:** Switch between Anime (Niji-style), Photorealistic, and 3D Render styles instantly.
* **Smart Prompt Enhancement:** Automatically optimizes simple keywords into detailed prompts.

## 🚀 Usage & Online Tool
The core generation engine is hosted on our main platform. You can access the tool and start generating images immediately without installation.

**👉 Start Generating (Web App):**

## 📂 Prompt Engineering Resources
We believe in open knowledge. In this repository, we will also update our "Best Practices" for prompt engineering.

**Example Prompt Structure:**
> `(Subject), (Action), (Art Style), (Lighting), (Camera Angle) --ar 16:9`

For a full library of tested prompts and negative embedding lists, please visit our **[Model Showcase & Gallery](https://www.seedream4-5.cc)** on the main site.
